# 1. Idea Brief

## Problem Context

Rural and semi-urban classrooms often face:
- High student-to-teacher load
- Multi-grade teaching (for example, one teacher handling classes 2, 3, and 4 together)
- Limited time for individual remediation
- Language barriers (children answer in local languages)

## Proposed Idea

Shiksha Saathi is an AI-assisted, voice-first remedial platform that helps one teacher manage mixed classrooms by continuously assessing learner responses, detecting concept gaps, and generating student-specific guidance.

## How Is This Different From Existing Ideas?

Most existing systems are:
- Static content repositories
- One-size-fits-all test engines
- Dashboard-only analytics with little classroom adaptation

Shiksha Saathi is different because it combines:
- Live spoken-response evaluation
- AI-powered remedial feedback per answer
- Multi-grade teacher load intelligence (teacher-child ratio aware grouping)
- Bilingual interface (English/Hindi) and local language support in response analysis

## How Will It Solve the Problem?

- For students: gives immediate feedback and preparation guidance after each answer
- For teachers: prioritizes high-risk concepts and students instead of manual tracking
- For multi-grade classrooms: suggests grouped remediation plans based on grade + risk + available teacher time

## USP (Unique Selling Proposition)

- AI remediation engine integrated directly into answer flow (not post-hoc reporting only)
- Practical for low-resource schools (offline queue + low-bandwidth compatible)
- Multi-grade aware planning for single-teacher classrooms
- End-to-end roles: admin, teacher, student in one platform
